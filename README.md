## About

BookTrack is an open-source project aimed at improving the way we manage personal libraries. It provides a simple command-line interface to interact with the system, allowing you to track books and categorize them based on author, genre, or title.

This project is ideal for learning and implementing basic C++ concepts such as file handling, classes, and object-oriented programming (OOP).

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete books
- View a list of books in your collection
- Search for books by title or author
- Save data to a text file for persistence
- Simple, user-friendly interface

## Installation

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:

- A C++ compiler (GCC or Clang)
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion, or any other C++ IDE)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ryuas/booktrack-cpp.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd booktrack-cpp
    ```

3. Compile the project using your C++ compiler:

    ```bash
    g++ -o booktrack main.cpp
    ```

4. Run the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./booktrack
    ```

## Usage

Once the program is running, you'll be prompted with a simple menu to interact with your book collection:

1. Add a new book
2. Edit an existing book
3. Delete a book
4. View all books
5. Search for books by title or author

Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the options.

## Technologies

This project is built using:

- **C++**: For the core functionality and object-oriented design.
- **File I/O**: To save and load the book collection from a text file.
- **Standard Library**: Using STL containers like `vector` and `string`.
